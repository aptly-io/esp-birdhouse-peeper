title "Major states of the Birdhouse Peeper IoT"

note top of Operating
  List up the GPIO pins
  used in each state
  Think about jtag/uart/PSRAM/external Flash
end note

[*] --> Provisioning

note right of Provisioning: BLE based, WiFi activate

state Operating {

  state Idling
  state AudioVideoMonitoring
  state SensorUploading
  state SensorsActive

  note left of Idling: light/deep sleep mode
  note bottom of AudioVideoMonitoring: WiFi, camera, microphone active
  note bottom of SensorUploading
    Sensor data used for ML training cloud service
    - WiFi active:
      mobile as a gateway to a cloud service
    - Mobile data active:
      directly upload into cloud service
    (Newer models are part of a FotA?)
  end note
  note bottom of SensorsActive
    I2C sensors active:
      - Light sensor (measures luminosity),
      - Accelerator sensor (measures acceleration in X, Y, Z)
        Some sensor interrupt movement, tilt, lifting etc
      - Environmental sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure)
      - Battery sensor
    microphone, camera periodically
      - Sound (as PCM samples)
      - Picture (memory optimal)
    Currently all sensor are planned inside the smallish birdhouse
  end note


  state SensorsActive {
    state MemoryRecording
    state MemoryBackup

    note bottom of MemoryBackup: SDcard GPIO active

    MemoryRecording --> MemoryBackup: MemoryFull
    MemoryBackup --> MemoryRecording: BackupFinished

    --

    state SensorMonitoring

    note right of SensorMonitoring
      Event/alert inferencing from
      sensor data and timing
    end note
  }

  Idling --> AudioVideoMonitoring: BleAVRequest
  AudioVideoMonitoring --> Idling: Disconnect

  Idling --> SensorUploading: BleUploadRequest
  SensorUploading --> Idling: UploadFinished

  Idling --> SensorsActive
  SensorsActive --> Idling

}

Provisioning --> Idling

Operating --> Provisioning: FactoryReset
